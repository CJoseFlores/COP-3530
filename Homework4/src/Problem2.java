 I hereby certify that this work is my own and none of it is the work of
 any other person.
 * Questions:
 * PART (A): The algorithm for my implemented linearSort() is O(n) because
 * it iterates through the entire array to count the number of zeroes (which 
 * is O(n)) and then it iterates through the array one more time and 
 * overrides the values with 0's or 1's, which is O(n). Therefore the entire
 * algorithm is T(n) = O(n) + O(n), which is simply T(n) = O(n).
 * Part (B2): The algorithm for my implemented specialRadixSort() is O(d * (r + n))
 * Starting with the first for loop, I am adding empty buckets to the bucket array,
 * this operation is O(r) because there are "r" buckets (in this case 10).
 * The second for loop finds the biggest number of digits in any of the numbers
 * in the array to sort. This iterates through the whole array of size "n", so
 * this operation is O(n). The while loop is what actually does the radix sorting.
 * The while loop will execute "d" times, where "d" is the number of digits
 * calculated from the previous operation; this is the amount of bucket sorts
 * that will be performed. Inside the while loop, the first loop performs bucket
 * sort on one of the digits of each number and is only dependant on the size
 * of the array, so this operation is O(n). The second for loop inside the while
 * loop iterates through the array of buckets, and then through each bucket. 
 * This nested for loop is O(r + n) because it iterates through "r" buckets,
 * and after the entire iteration, you are guaranteed to have also iterated
 * through "n" elements because all of the array's elements are located in the
 * buckets. Our time complexity function then is 
 * T(n) = O(r) + O(n) + O(d * [O(n) + O(r + n)])
 * Which simplfies to:
 * T(n) = O(r) + O(n) + O(d * [O(r + n)])   then,
 * T(n) = O(r) + O(n) + O(d * (r + n))    and finally, 
 * T(n) = O(d * (r + n)).
