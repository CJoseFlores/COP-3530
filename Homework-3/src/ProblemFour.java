 * Questions:
 * PART (A):
 * The actual algorithm is implemented in the "pivotedSearch()" method.
 * PART (B):
 * The implemented algorithm is O(log n), explanation:
 * 
 * The first thing pivotedSearch() does is call the recursive private method
 * "pivotIndex()" which attempts to find the pivot point of a possibly rotated
 * array. Because it is a recursive method, it requires some base cases. The 
 * first base case is that low index of the array is > the high index, which 
 * means that we have iterated through the whole array and did not find a pivot
 * so it returns "-1" since no pivot was found. Another base case is that the 
 * low index == high index, meaning that the pivot is exactly the low/high value.
 * We then check if the pivot is either the element to the left of the mid, or
 * the mid itself. Otherwise, we need to check either the left or right
 * portion of the array (from the mid) for the pivot. On every recursive call
 * to check either the left or right portion, the size of the array is divided
 * by 2, so in the end the complexity of pivotIndex() is O(log n).
 * 
 * After the pivotIndex() method has been executed, we perform binarySearches
 * on different portions of the array (from the pivot). If pivotIndex() did not
 * find the pivot, then the array is still pre-sorted, so perform a simple
 * binary search (which is O(log n)). Otherwise, ONLY perform a binary search
 * on either the right or left side of the array. Either way, we perform
 * binary search on the array, which is simply O(log n).
 * 
 * Therefore the complexity of pivotedSearch(), T(n) = O(log n) + O(log n) = O(log n)
 * where the first "O(log n)" is pivotIndex() and the second "O(log n)" is 
 * a binary search.
 * 
 * i.e. the complexity of pivotedSearch() is O(log n).
