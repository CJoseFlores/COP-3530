/*********************************************************************
 Purpose/Description: Searches an array by dividing the array by 3, and recursively
 * calling itself to search one of the three sectors until element is found or
 * it is determined the element does not exist in the array.

 any other person.
 * Question (B):
 * The time complexity of the method "terSearch()" is O(log N). On every 
 * recursive call, the input size (array) is divided by 3 by shifting either
 * "l" or "r" or both to one of the sectors defined by "d1" and "d2". Using the
 * logarithmic rule, then the complexity is log3(N), which is simply O(log N).
