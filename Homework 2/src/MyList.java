 Purpose/Description: MyList is a List that can push and pop from the front,
                      as well as inject an item to the back.

 Complexity Explanation:
 * The requirements of the problem says we MUST use the LinkedList class from
 * the Java Standard Library.
 * The description of the "LinkedList" class specifies "All of the operations 
 * perform as could be expected for a doubly-linked list. Operations that index 
 * into the list will traverse the list from the beginning or the end, 
 * whichever is closer to the specified index."
 * This description tells us that it uses a "head" and "tail" pointer.
 * therefore, the "addFirst()" method is O(1) because it simply makes a new node,
 * sets head.next to the new node, and finally sets head as the new node. This
 * is independent of the list size. This means that myPush is O(1).
 * "removeFirst()" is also O(1) because it simply sets head to head.next, therefore
 * myPop() is O(1). Finally, "addLast()" is O(1) because we have a tail pointer,
 * so it simply makes a new node, sets tail.next to the new node, and then 
 * sets tail to the new node; i.e. "myInject()" is O(1).
